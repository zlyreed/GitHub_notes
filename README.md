## Notes on how to use Github 
   - [How to "unfork"/delete a repository](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-delete-a-project-I-forked-on-GitHub)
     - On the project page, on the right-hand side, there's a column "<> Code". Click "Settings" at the bottom of that column, just above the HTTPS clone url.  The settings for the repository include a section titled "Danger Zone" at the bottom of the page with the option to "Delete this Repository." 
     
   - [How to rename a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/renaming-a-repository/)
     - On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Under your repository name, click  Settings. Under the Repository Name heading, type the new name of your repository. Click Rename. You're done!
